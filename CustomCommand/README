In this module 'Bluethink_CustomCommand' we created the custom console CLI command.

In this module we created a command just for testing and for this command we created two arguments to reflect the different data.

The command is 'Sudo php bin/magento custom:demo'. 
	->And the argument is - 1) name 
				 2) desc(description)
				 
Command with 'name' argument is - "sudo php bin/magento custom:demo --name='your Name'";
	->command shows some text with your name.
	
Command with 'desc' argument is - "sudo php bin/magento custom:demo --desc='desc'";
	->command shows description of the command.
